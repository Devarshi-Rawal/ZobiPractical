Hello coders!I would like to present an app which inspired me from a recent interview task I was assigned with.

The key feature of this app is `NetworkCallBack` which allows app to observe network state changes through network call backs.

## Note
Test the app by openeing it in absence of internet. Perform tests with network state changes. Pull to refresh listing
